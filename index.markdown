## Hey there!

 My name is Navid Madani and I'm the resident Conversational AI enthusiast at the University at Buffalo,
Former machine learning engineer at Tapsi Co. with a BSc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran,
wearing the hat of a PhD student by day (and honestly, by night too).
 
My quest? To pioneer AI that doesn't just talk
but truly communicates, providing emotional support through rich, meaningful and long conversations.
Think of it as teaching machines the art of heartfelt dialogue with a sprinkle of empathy.
I'm not just programming responses; I'm architecting causal models and incorporating human-centric psychological strategies
that enable AI to engage deeply and keep the conversational ball rolling for more than just a quick exchange.
Itâ€™s a complex, fascinating journey into making digital chats feel as warm and personal as a
cup of coffee with an old friend.
